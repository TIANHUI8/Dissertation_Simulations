# Dissertation_Simulations
A set of R scripts used to simulate GWAS data in order to test variable selection methods

## Contents
### Sim_a.R
This script will simulate SNP marker data with 5 different possible confounding factors:
* n (sample size) vs. p (marker number) ratio
* correlation among markers
* family structure
* measurement error
* model complexity

This script can create 4 simulated data sets with different combinations of the above factors.
